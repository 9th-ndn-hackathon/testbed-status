# ndn-testbed-test

This repository contains an implementation of a NDN testbed monitoring tool. The application reads a list of nodes supporting fch from a JSON file. For each node, the application registers a distinguish prefix. After that, we periodically send Interest packets between each pair of nodes.

The statistics (the number of successful transmisions) are stored in python pandas and written to a CSV file. The file can be then read by `display_stats.py` and displayed as a heatmap.

## INSTALLATION

The application requires python >= 3.6 and pandas and PyNDN2.

It uses the default identity stored in the KeyChain on the hosting machine.
